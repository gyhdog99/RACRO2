# NOTE(linjunrong): Due to recent fp8 support in SGLang. Now importing any symbol relate to SGLang's model_runner would check CUDA device capability.
# However, due to veRL's setting, the main process of ray can not find any CUDA device, which would potentially lead to:
# "RuntimeError: No CUDA GPUs are available".
# For this reason, sharding_manager.__init__ should not import SGLangShardingManager and user need to import use the abs path.
